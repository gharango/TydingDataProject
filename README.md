# TydingDataProject
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis
R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

  1  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  
  2  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  
  3  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  
  4  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

  5  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The data for the project has been downloaded into the current directory from:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
the file downloaded is "getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip"

The file CodeBook.md describes the original variables/features, the resulting variables for the first extracted data set and the second extracted data set which will be writen as the result of the execution of run_analysis.R
